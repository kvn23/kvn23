### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kevin Karl and I recently graduated with a master's degree in information system. The topics of interest during my many university years changed frequently, ranging from project and innovation management to mobile application development. During my last year in university, I ultimately focused on data science topics, such as machine learning and simple descriptive analytics. Subsequently, the focus of my thesis was on explainable AI methods, in particular the usage of Python libraries to augment ML predictions with better explanations.

If you are reading this, you probably received a job application by me or somehow Google lead you here. Either way, feel free to browse my portfolio repository to get a glimpse on what I've been working on!

##### Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ... mastering my data analytics and visualisation skills in Python with the help of [dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/) courses. Hopefully, I will be able to share some new work soon!
- ... upcycling old furniture and generally practicing related woodworking skills.
- ... improving my range of baking with sourdough. Currently working through the book *New World Sourdough* by [Bryan Ford](https://www.artisanbryan.com/).
- **... finding employment ;)**
