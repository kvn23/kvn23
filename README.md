### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kevin Karl and I recently graduated with a master's degree in information system. The topics of interest during my many university years changed frequently, ranging from project and innovation management to mobile application development. During my last year in university, I ultimately focused on data science topics, such as machine learning and simple descriptive analytics. Subsequently, the focus of my thesis was on explainable AI topics, in particular the usage of Python libraries to augment ML predictions with better explanations.

If you are reading this, you probably received a job application by me or somehow found a useful code snipped through google. Either way, feel free to browse my portfolio repository, to get a glimpse on what I've been working on!

Currently I am working on mastering my data analytics and visualisation skills with the help of dataquest courses. Hopefully, I will be able to share some new work soon.
